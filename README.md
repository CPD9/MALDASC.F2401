# Cervical Spine Fracture Detection Project
Conttributors: Peter, CJ, Omar, Raph

Welcome to our project on Cervical Spine Fracture Detection, inspired by the RSNA 2022 Cervical Spine Fracture Detection competition on Kaggle. This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning models to accurately detect cervical spine fractures from CT scans.

## Project Goals

- **Objective:** Develop and validate models to identify fractures in CT scans of the cervical spine.
- **Datasets:** Utilize comprehensive datasets consisting of CT scans with and without cervical spine fractures, similar to the dataset provided in the RSNA competition.
- **Models:** Implement state-of-the-art deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in fracture detection.

## Data

The data for this project includes CT scans of the cervical spine. These scans are annotated to indicate the presence of fractures at both the individual vertebra and patient level. The original dataset from the RSNA competition consists of thousands of CT scans collected from multiple institutions.

## Methods

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardize and preprocess the CT scan images for input into the machine learning models.
2. **Model Training:** Train various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures to detect fractures.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Challenges

- **Large File Sizes:** The models developed in this project exceed 100MB in size and therefore could not be uploaded directly to GitHub. Instead, we have hosted these models on Google Drive.

## Accessing the Models

The trained models can be accessed and downloaded from the following Google Drive link:

## How to Run the Code

**Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CPD9/MALDASC.F2401.git
